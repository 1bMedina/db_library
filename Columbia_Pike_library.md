# Columbia Pike Library
Adam Hellinga & Blu Medina

The Columbia Pike Library is located next to the career center and is one of the nine libraries in the Arlington Public Library system. This library is used for a variety of reasons, but it is primarily used for leisurely reading and to socialize rather than research.

# Current System

## Sorting Method
The current system is split into non-fiction and fiction, with the fiction section split into genres like romance and mystery.

We liked this system, but felt it could be improved.

## Browsing System
A small kiosk to search up books in the system.

Audiobooks and e-books are available on libby, and their website has the library systems physical books.

Use a combination of authors last name to sort fiction, and the Dewey Decimal system for non-fiction.

We liked the searching system, however we believe it can be improved. We also feel that making the digital resources more intuitive can assist in finding books.

We also felt that the different systems to sort the books could also be improved.

## Hold System
If a book is checked out, someone can put their name on the hold list and once the book is returned it is placed on the hold shelf with a slip of paper with the patrons name.

We liked this system but felt there may be some improvements that could be made to improve efficiency.

## Return System
A book can be returned 3 ways: 
- Dropped in the 24hr book drop
- Dropped in the book drop open during opening hours
- Handed to a librarian at the counter

This system works well but can be adjusted to work with other improvements.

## Redistribution
Columbia Pike Library is a branch of the Arlington Public Library system. This means that books can be returned to any library, and can be moved from one library to another.

# Our Improvements

## Sorting Method
### Genres
We believe that the current sorting method by genre and type of book works well, but can be improved.

We believe that by going more specific on the genres can improve browsing efficiency.

Larger genres like mystery and young adult could be split into sub-genres like horror in mystery, and romance within young adult.

We also think adding clear labels above each section could help in understanding the organization of the library.

By standardizing the sorting system to be uniform, it would also reduce confusion. This could be done by sorting all the books by authors last name in each section. This would remove any confusion relating to the Dewey Decimal system.

## Browsing System
### Mobile Systems
The main goal of our improvements to the mobile systems is to make them more intuitive.

By making the websites more clear, possibly by combining them or connecting them in some way.

One way to do this could be by adding a catalog option on libby to show what library a book is at, if it is currently checked out, allow you to put the book on hold, and if you want to request its transfer to another library.

### In Library System
The current system works well when used properly, which is not always the case.

By creating a more foolproof system, it would become more intuitive and easier to use, improving accessibility.

One way to do this is to replace the current computer with a series of smaller computers that can only open the catalog. 

This could be done through Raspberry Pi's which can be programmed to only open the website, limiting the amount of ways it can be broken.

Another improvement could be making the website more intuitive for younger demographics. You could add a station for smaller childeren to search by a subject, not name.

This would work with the improvements to the mobile and digital services to make the catalog easier to understand and search.

### Obtaining New Books
We believe that new books could be better fit to the library by adding a survey that is simple, quick, and easily accessible to everyone.

This would allow the books that flow into the library to better fit what people want to read.

## Hold System
The current system works well, so our suggestions are minor.

One way to improve the hold system could be to make it easier to find which book is yours, possibly by splitting the hold shelf based on genre, and then sort by the last name of the person who is holding the book.

As stated earlier, you could use a digital tool like libby to allow people to out books on hold remotely, and request a library for that book to be stored at before they pick it up. Libby also allows notifications to be sent once the book is ready.

## Return System
The current book drops work well, but can be used to improve efficiency.

Our idea on how to improve the return system is to add a "recently returned" section to the library.

This could be easily done by moving the return shelves that are kept in the back by the librarians out into the public. 

This would allow for the popular books that are being checked out to be set aside, allowing people to browse what books are popular each day.

You could clear out this section each day, or as it gets full take off the books that have been on the shelf the longest.

The book drops could be changed to support this by implementing scanners that check the book back in once it is dropped off.

## Fixing Missplacements
Our previously stated labeling system would assist in making sure books get put in the correct section.

You could also add bins or carts around the library for books if people do not remember exactly where the book went.

Adding signs to mark these carts or to remind people to use them could decrease the amount of books that get put back in the wrong spot.

You could also add an occasional shelf check on popular sections that people browse to make sure all the books are in the correct locations.

# Differences

## Sorting Method
Making the genres more specific than they currently are.

Adding labels to mark each section to make browsing easier.

Standardize the sorting system to all be by authors last name.
## Browsing System
Make the mobile apps more intuitive, and simplified.

In the library, refine the browsing devices by adding many, simpler systems that can only open the digital tools to browse the catalog. 

Adding systems specifically designed for younger demographics could assist them in finding books.

Making surveys simple and clear could help get public input on what books they would like to see in their library.
## Hold System
Adding a digital tool to assist in placing hold and requesting their transfer to a specific library could assist in people getting the books they want.

Adding sections based on genres to the hold shelf could reduce confusion.
## Return System
Adding a section labeled "recently returned" could make reshelving simpler and allow people to find popular books.

Automating the scanning books as they come through the book drops could simplify the process and make it easier for the librarians.

## Missplacements
Adding carts or bins in each section for books when people do not know where they go can reduce the chances of someone putting the book back in the wrong spot.

Labeling sections can assist in making sure that books get put back in the correct sections.

Doing occasional shelf checks on popular sections can help make sure those sections are properly sorted.
