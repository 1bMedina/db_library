# Columbia Pike Library

## Sorting Method
### Genre 
- general (fiction, non-fiction)
    - specific(mystery, young adult)
        - extra specific (horror within mystery, romance within young adult)
        - by authors last name once sorted into extra specific
- labels that make it extremely clear where everything goes

## Browsing System 
### Mobile 
- Push a mobile app like libby
    - add a 'catalog' option to libby to be able to find books and not just see their availability
### In Library System 
- Adding a foolproof system on the browsing systems
    - more Raspberry Pi's only with the database system
    - access one server that can also be accessed on a website
    - update catalog to be more intuitive 
### Getting New Books
- Rely on public not statistics
    - public survey often 
        - make it short
    

## Hold System
### Mobile 
- Push mobile apps like libby
    - built in hold system, request & notification
### In Person
- Sort by genre
    - sort by last name of person holding

## Return System 
### In Person
- Returned through book drops (2-3 24/7)
    - Then checked in and looked at for popularity
        - Most popular books goes on displays at the front
- reshelved everyday to keep up with the most popular books
### Fixing Chance of Misplacement
- labels that make it extremely clear where everything goes
- bins around the library for people to put books that they don't know where it goes
    - a sign reminding them to use the bins instead of randomly placing a book places
- occasional shelf check (likely on the more popular shelves)
